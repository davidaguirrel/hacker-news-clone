# hacker-news-clone

## Info
This is my attempt to work with Hacker News API and practice with React and React Router.

In order to build a portfolio where I can show my Front End skills, I have developed a clone of Hacker News using **React, React Router** and concepts like **React Context, Reusable Components, Class Fields and Code Splitting.**

### Installation
